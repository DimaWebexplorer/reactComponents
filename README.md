# Components made with React and TypeScript
## Description of the project

Two components have been implemented using React. The first component is a card and the second is an image. Both are in the components folder and each contains its own props interfaces and logic.
Interfaces were chosen for props because it's a faster, more flexible and secure way to achieve reusability. The logic of this project was written in TypeScript because it gives us more security by using types. Although we can easily reimplement the logic using JavaScript objects.
